        Sebastian and I met at a swim meet when we were 14 years old, but I didn't meet my husband until 10 years later.
        <br /><br />

        As teenagers, we couldn't have been more different. I was a cautious, pragmatist with a stubborn-will,
        and he was a free-spirited, idealist, with an impish sense of humor. Needless to say, we clashed.
        <br /><br />

        However, as our lives intersected over the years, those qualities that held us at odds in our adolescence,
        became the qualities that drew us together in adulthood.
        <br /><br />

        We both remained fiercely independent, curious people;
        and while we approached most aspects of life from different vantage points, the outcomes we sought were always the same.
        <br /><br />

        So when I asked him to dinner 7 years ago, I knew it was time for us to decide what path we went down next. I asked him frankly,
        "Are you in, or are you out? We can give this a try, or we can stick to being friends, but we have to pick a lane." He laughed softly and said, "I'm in."
        <br /><br />

        But the day I knew I wanted him to be my husband came 2 years later on our first vacation.
        <br /><br />

        I got a horrible case of food poisoning, but I convinced him (and myself) the next morning that I was up for a 4 mile hike down to a remote beach,
        because - as we've established - I'm stubborn.
        <br /><br />

        When we reached the water, my stomach went into knots and in a panicked sweat, I whispered, "I need a bathroom. NOW."
        <br /><br />

        He ran up and down that beach for a while trying to find a secluded spot for me that could act as a bathroom,
        but we eventually decided to try and climb back up to the park bathrooms. He repeatedly offered to hold up his shirt for cover when I thought for sure I wouldn't make it in time. But I made it!
        <br /><br />

        When I came back out, he hugged me, and we laughed until we were out of breath. The trip only got worse from there,
        but we never stopped laughing. That's when I knew. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, he would always be my person.
