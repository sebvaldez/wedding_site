        Sebastian and I met at a swim meet when we were 14 years old, but I didn't meet my husband until 10 years later.
        <br /><br />

        As teenagers, we couldn't have been more different. In many ways we still are, but Sebastian is the whimsy my life has always been missing.
        When life feels like it's bearing down, his air lifts it up and lets you out from underneath.
        <br /><br />

        In the decade between 14 and 24, we slowly shifted from kids who ran in overlapping circles,
        to friends with a deep respect for and inherent understanding of the other.
        <br /><br />

        The day I knew I wanted him to be my husband came 2 years into dating, on our first vacation.
        <br /><br />

        I got a horrible case of food poisoning, but I convinced him (and myself) the next morning that I was up for a 4 mile hike down to a remote beach.
        When we reached the water, my stomach went into knots and in a panicked sweat, I whispered, "I need a bathroom. NOW."
        <br /><br />

        He ran up and down that beach for a while trying to find a secluded spot for me that could act as a bathroom,
        but we eventually decided to try and climb back up to the park bathrooms.
        He repeatedly offered to hold up his shirt for cover when I thought for sure I wouldn't make it in time.
        But I made it! All throughout I remember thinking "Well, it will either be over after this, or we will have fallen in love."
        <br /><br />

        When I came back out, he hugged me, and we laughed until we were out of breath. The trip only got worse from there,
        but we never stopped laughing. That's when I knew. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, he was my person.
