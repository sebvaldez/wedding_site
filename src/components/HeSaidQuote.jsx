        Allegra and I have always stayed in touch after moving out of Lodi, where we grew up.

        <br /><br />
        We are both independent and curious people in nature, shared qualities that created an instinctual sense of respect, comfort and trust.
        <br /><br />

        During moments of significant change, whether it was moving, leaving a job, or needing another’s perspective on life,
        we reached out to each other. This kind of friendship grew into a relationship once she moved to the Bay Area. During this time we had some of the most memorable laughs and conversations while exploring great coffee and food.
        <br /><br />

        Having Allegra in my life is like have a secret power up! Whether it lasts months or hours,
        she takes an interest in my hobbies and work, sharing my enthusiasm each step of the way.
        Experiencing this in a relationship is something i’ve not had before.
        I love the particular ways in which she keeps me organized (even my doom piles, haha sorry babe).
        <br /><br />

        As the moment approached to shop for a ring, I felt an immense pressure to find the perfect one,
        ensuring every detail and 'tech spec' was just right. Then, during one of my online searches,
        I stumbled upon <strong>THE ONE</strong>. Even though it was just a image, I needed to hold it immediately.
        That ring transported me into our future, I saw our life together as I was flooded with excitement,
        joy and love for Allegra with the hopes of asking her to marry me.
        <br /><br />

        I am incredibly thankful to have her as my future wife and continuing to reciprocate that same energy she puts in.
